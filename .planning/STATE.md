## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Scoping]: Security before launch - cannot ship known vulnerabilities
- [Scoping]: Partner Portal = Phase 1 MVP - key distribution channel
- [Scoping]: Gift system deprioritized - not critical for go-to-market
- [Scoping]: Bank account fields removed in favor of Stripe Connect exclusive (SEC-06)
- [01-01]: Use sessionClaims.metadata.role for ADMIN check (requires Clerk session customization)
- [01-01]: Redirect non-admin users to /dashboard instead of 403 (better UX)
- [01-01]: Allow /api/webhooks/* through without middleware auth (webhooks self-verify)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [01-01]: Clerk session customization may be required for role in sessionClaims.metadata - verify Clerk Dashboard configuration

## Planning Notes

### Phase 1 Planning Summary (2026-01-26)

**Research findings that affected planning:**
- SEC-04 (email token) is ALREADY SATISFIED - code enforces 32+ char secret in production
- SEC-05 (documents user ID) is ALREADY SATISFIED - uses authenticated user.id from Clerk
- Middleware is a complete no-op - needs full clerkMiddleware implementation
- SendGrid uses custom crypto - needs @sendgrid/eventwebhook SDK
- PartnerPayoutMethod should be removed - Stripe Connect is already integrated

**Plans created:**
1. **01-01** - Admin route middleware (clerkMiddleware with role checking) - COMPLETE
2. **01-02** - SendGrid webhook SDK (replace custom crypto with official SDK)
3. **01-03** - Bank data removal (remove PartnerPayoutMethod, update UI)

**Wave structure:** All 3 plans in Wave 1 (parallel, no dependencies between them)
